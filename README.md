An experimental open-source application that integrates the OpenAi gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 or gpt-4-1106-preview models via API, NLP, TTS, STT, and an OBD-II ELM327 device to create a voice-activated, hands-free, vehicle diagnostic assistant.

‚ö†Ô∏è ***This is a work in progress*** ‚ö†Ô∏è

03/17/2024: Updated to use the [OpenAI v1.14.2]https://github.com/openai/openai-python/releases/)

11/14/2023: Added "development" branch with the option to use text input in the terminal instead of voice commands.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built and tested using:

- Windows 11 & Ubuntu 22.04
- Python 3.12
- Requires [Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)
- [OBDlink MX+ Bluetooth ELM327](https://www.obdlink.com/products/obdlink-mxp/)
- Desktop testing is possible using an [ELM327 emulator](https://github.com/Ircama/ELM327-emulator)

## üìü Using an ELM Simulator

<details>
ELM327 emulator: [GitHub](https://github.com/Ircama/ELM327-emulator)
com0com virtual serial port driver: [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/) (to create a virtual COM port pair).

After installing com0com, run:

```bash
elm -p COM6 -a 500000
```

Set the COM port in the `.env` file to `COM7`.

## üìà Data Stream (Under Construction)

```bash
python air_fuel_datastream.py
```

Streams data from the OBD-II ELM327 device to the console, but there's currently no way to stop the stream other than closing the application.
