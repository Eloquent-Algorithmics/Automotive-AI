An experimental open-source application that integrates the OpenAi gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 or gpt-4-1106-preview models via API, NLP, TTS, STT, and an OBD-II ELM327 device to create a voice-activated, hands-free, vehicle diagnostic assistant.

‚ö†Ô∏è ***This is a work in progress*** ‚ö†Ô∏è

11/12/2023: Updated to use [OpenAI v1.2.3](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/releases/)

üîú ElevenLabs TTS, Google Calendar integration coming soon.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built and tested using:

- Windows 11 & Ubuntu 22.04
- Python 3.11.6
- OBDlink MX+ Bluetooth ELM327
- 2005 and 2021 Ford Vehicles
- Desktop testing using an ELM327 emulator

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Explorergt92/Automotive-AI.git
```

2. Create a conda environment and activate it: [Download Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)
### Linux or Windows
```bash or PowerShell
conda create -n autoai python=3.11

conda install -n autoai -c conda-forge python=3.11

conda activate autoai
```

3. Run the following command in the root directory:
### Linux
```bash
./install.sh
```
### Windows
```PowerShell
.\install.bat
```

4. Set your API keys and variables in the `.env.template` file and save it as `.env` without a file extension.

## üèÅ Running the Application

Without a vehicle communication interface:

```bash
python main.py
```

With an ELM327 device connected:

```bash
python main.py --device elm327
```

## üéôÔ∏è Voice Commands

Current voice commands include:

- "engine rpm"
- "intake air temperature"
- "fuel tank level"
- "time run with MIL on"
- "engine coolant temperature"
- "read trouble codes"
- "freeze frame data"
- "pending trouble codes"
- "clear trouble codes"
- "vehicle identification number"
- "calibration id message count"
- "calibration id"
- "calibration verification numbers"
- "start a diagnostic report"
- "send a diagnostic report"
- "next on outlook calendar"
- "create a new outlook appointment"
- "check outlook"
- "send an email with outlook"
- "ask question"
- "start a conversation"
- "check gmail"
- "what's next on my google calendar"

After a conversation has been started you can use the following voice commands to manage the conversation:

- "clear all history"
- "delete the last message"
- "end the conversation"
- "summarize the conversation history"


## üìü ELM Simulator

ELM327 emulator: [GitHub](https://github.com/Ircama/ELM327-emulator)
com0com virtual serial port driver: [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/) (to create a virtual COM port pair).

After installing com0com, run:

```bash
elm -p COM6 -a 500000
```

Set the COM port in the `.env` file to `COM7`.

## üìà Data Stream (Under Construction)

```bash
python air_fuel_datastream.py
```

Streams data from the OBD-II ELM327 device to the console, but there's currently no way to stop the stream other than closing the application.
